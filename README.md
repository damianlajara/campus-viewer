# Welcome to Campus Viewer

## Purpose
Looking for a college that you would like to attend? Or maybe even looking for quick information like a specific school's contact information or address? Look no further! Campus Viewer makes it easy to search for any CUNY or SUNY school right from your terminal.

## Overview
Right after running the program, you should see a main menu allowing you to search CUNY schools, SUNY schools or even exit the program.

Note: The first time it is ran, it will take a few seconds to gather all the information from various schools. In the meantime enjoy seeing Pacman eat away in the terminal :D However, on every subsequent run, the data will be saved, so it would be drastically faster.

If you choose to view SUNY schools, it will give you a list of all SUNY campuses.

If you choose to view CUNY schools, it will gather all the community, senior and professional colleges and display it to you as a list.

Once You have chosen a school, whether it's CUNY or SUNY, you will be shown some quick information about that school. If you choose to view the school, it will then open up a Google Map in your browser allowing you to get more information!

## Run
